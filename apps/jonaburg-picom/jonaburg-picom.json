  "description": "This is a forked version from Sandmark's picom branch, including Blackcapcoder's animation code inside. The animations here are further smoothed and time deltas reduced from 1ms to 40us for high refresh rates and buttery smooth transitions. You'll need to run it with the experimental backend with: picom --experimental-backend",
